You need to install rustup https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install

install rust version rustc 1.41.0 (5e1a79984 2020-01-27) with  > rustup default 1.41.0


In order to make this project work you have to download transformers-2.11.0.zip modify setup.py as    "tokenizers == 0.10.0",

then you need to install that transformers manually with install python setup.py install

I have included that in the github repository



For having cuda enabled torch you need to delete installed torchs and install them via

https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu116

also you have to give a full path otherwise inference py will not work

python inference.py --pretrained-model=roberta-large --weight-path=roberta-large-en.pt --language=en --in-file="C:\punctuation-restoration\data\test_en.txt" --out-file="C:\punctuation-restoration\data\test_fixed.txt"
